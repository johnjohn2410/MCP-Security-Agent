# Threat Model

## Overview

This document outlines the threat model for the MCP Security Agent, detailing what the tool scans, what it doesn't scan, and the security considerations for its use in enterprise environments.

## What MCP Security Agent Scans

### Code Vulnerabilities
- **SQL Injection**: Detects user input directly concatenated into SQL queries

- **Command Injection**: Finds shell command execution with user input
- **Path Traversal**: Detects file path manipulation vulnerabilities
- **Insecure Deserialization**: Identifies unsafe object deserialization
- **Hardcoded Secrets**: Finds API keys, passwords, tokens in source code

### Dependencies
- **Vulnerable Packages**: Checks against CVE databases for known vulnerabilities
- **Outdated Dependencies**: Identifies packages with security updates available
- **License Compliance**: Validates license compatibility and restrictions
- **Supply Chain Risks**: Detects suspicious package behavior

### Configuration Security
- **Environment Variables**: Validates secure configuration practices
- **File Permissions**: Checks for overly permissive file access
- **Network Security**: Reviews network configuration settings
- **Authentication**: Validates authentication and authorization settings

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Cloud Configurations**: Scans AWS, Azure, GCP configuration files
- **Container Security**: Reviews Docker and Kubernetes configurations
- **CI/CD Security**: Validates pipeline security settings

## What MCP Security Agent Does NOT Scan

### Runtime Security
- **Active Exploitation**: Does not attempt to exploit vulnerabilities
- **Network Scanning**: Does not scan network infrastructure
- **Penetration Testing**: Does not perform active penetration testing
- **Social Engineering**: Does not test human factors or social engineering

### Data Privacy
- **Personal Data**: Does not collect or store personal information
- **Business Secrets**: Does not extract or transmit business secrets
- **Source Code**: Does not upload or transmit source code to external services

### System Access
- **File System**: Does not access files outside the specified scan path
- **Network Access**: Does not make unauthorized network connections
- **System Resources**: Does not access system resources beyond scanning needs

## Security Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Validation → Scanner → Analysis → Report Generation → Output
     ↓           ↓          ↓         ↓            ↓              ↓
  Sanitized   Filtered   Isolated   Processed   Formatted    Delivered
```

### Isolation Boundaries
- **Process Isolation**: Each scanner runs in isolated processes
- **File System**: Restricted to specified scan directories
- **Network**: Limited to authorized vulnerability databases
- **Memory**: Bounded memory usage with cleanup

### Data Protection
- **Redaction**: Sensitive data automatically redacted before processing
- **Tokenization**: Code and data tokenized for AI analysis
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all operations

## Threat Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Malicious Code Injection
**Threat**: Attacker attempts to inject malicious code into scan results
**Mitigation**: 
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding and escaping
- Process isolation and sandboxing

### Scenario 2: Data Exfiltration
**Threat**: Attempt to extract sensitive data during scanning
**Mitigation**:
- Data redaction and tokenization
- Network access controls
- Audit logging and monitoring

### Scenario 3: Resource Exhaustion
**Threat**: Malicious input causing resource exhaustion
**Mitigation**:
- Input size limits
- Timeout controls
- Memory usage bounds

### Scenario 4: Privilege Escalation
**Threat**: Attempt to gain elevated privileges
**Mitigation**:
- Non-root execution
- Minimal required permissions
- Process isolation

## Security Controls

### Access Controls
- **Authentication**: Optional API key authentication for AI features
- **Authorization**: Role-based access controls for enterprise features
- **Audit**: Comprehensive audit logging of all operations

### Data Controls
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit
- **Redaction**: Automatic redaction of sensitive patterns
- **Retention**: Configurable data retention policies

### Network Controls
- **Firewall**: Restricted network access to authorized endpoints
- **TLS**: All network communications encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **Proxies**: Support for enterprise proxy configurations

### Code Controls
- **Static Analysis**: All code undergoes static security analysis
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning of dependencies for vulnerabilities
- **Code Signing**: All releases cryptographically signed

## Compliance Considerations

### SOC 2 Type II
- **Security**: Comprehensive security controls implemented
- **Availability**: High availability with fault tolerance
- **Processing Integrity**: Accurate and complete processing
- **Confidentiality**: Data protection and privacy controls
- **Privacy**: Privacy controls for personal data

### ISO 27001

- **Risk Assessment**: Regular security risk assessments
- **Access Control**: Comprehensive access control measures
- **Incident Management**: Security incident response procedures

### GDPR
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data collected
- **Right to Erasure**: Data deletion capabilities
- **Privacy by Design**: Privacy controls built into design
- **Data Protection**: Technical and organizational measures

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **False Positives**: Incorrect vulnerability identification
- **False Negatives**: Missed security vulnerabilities
- **Data Breach**: Unauthorized access to scan data

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Impact**: Resource usage during scanning
- **Compatibility Issues**: Integration with existing tools
- **Configuration Errors**: Misconfiguration leading to security gaps

### Low Risk
